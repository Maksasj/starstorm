# Starstorm
Starstorm - space shooter, bullet hell game written in Rust using Bevy game engine. Graphically highly inspired by [Downwell](https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/), and gameplay probably Touhou, aka game from which this popular song called [Bad Apple](https://youtu.be/FtutLA63Cp8) came out ðŸ˜Š.

*And yet again, starstorm is a not a new javascript framework !*
